# S-Prototype - *A "SIEM from scratch" project* 🌠🛰️​
*@Xacone - 2021*

S-Prototype is a project on which I worked on in 2021 and which enabled me to improve my C++, Win32 APIs & QT skills. It is a light-weight SIEM that processes and aggregates real-time data from software agents located on other machines, such as real-time packet capture and analysis, as well as events occurring on the system, while providing an ergonomic graphical interface that enables real-time monitoring of events and processed information.
